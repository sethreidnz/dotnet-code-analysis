# Dotnet Code Analysis Sample

This project exists as a companion to the blog on my site [How to setup code analysis for .NET]( http://sethreid.co.nz/how-to-setup-code-analysis-dotnet) where i describe how to use the new Roslyn based analysers to enforce code style rules on your .NET applications.

The app was created using the [.NET Core Cli]() and running:

``` bash
cd src
dotnet new webapi DotnetCodeAnalysis.Api
``` 

The rest of the setup can be found [in the blog post](http://sethreid.co.nz/how-to-setup-code-analysis-dotnet)
